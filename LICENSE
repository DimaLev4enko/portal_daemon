Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have freedom to share, use, and change all versions of a program—and to make sure that you receive credit for your work. 

For the developers and authors, the GPL assures your right to get credit for your work. 

For the users of a program, the GPL guarantees your right to run, study, share, and change the software.
