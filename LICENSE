                  Version 3, 29 June 2007
                  
        Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                               Preamble

   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
   and other kinds of works.

   The license guarantees your freedom to share and change all versions of
   a program, to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
   This is done by guaranteeing that everyone else also has these freedoms.

   Specifically, the GNU General Public License is designed to ensure that
   you (the user) have the freedom to run, study, and change the software
   for any purpose. It also ensures that you can redistribute copies of
   the original program so you can help others.

   To make sure that everyone receives a fair chance to share in the
   benefits of the work, the license requires that everyone else also
   receive the same freedoms you have. Therefore, you must pass on the
   same freedoms to the next person who receives a copy of the program.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
   gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
   freedoms that you received. You must make sure that everyone else
   also receives or can get the source code. And you must show them
   these terms so they know their rights.

   Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps:

   (1) You can legally use, copy, distribute, and change the software.

   (2) When you distribute the software, you must pass on the same freedoms
   to those you distribute it to; when you receive software under GPL, you
   are equipped with certain legal relating to its use, including the right
   to copy it, modify it, and convey it to others.

   However, there are some responsibilities you must bear: follow the
   license terms (keep this license document with your distribution) and
   remain clear about your rights.

   In addition, if the license is embedded in the code you can provide the
   source code of the modified version and include a copy of this license.
   This will ensure that recipients can understand their rights by viewing
   the license text associated with the software that they received.

   Furthermore, because this license guarantees freedom, it ensures the
   liberty of future generations. You might call this a social contract to
   ensure a fair ground for everyone sharing and using the software.

   Every time you distribute this software, you must give the recipients a
   copy of this license along with it.  For each copyright holder, you must
   show their notice. If you can provide a link to the license text or
   include a reference to it in any message you send, this would be very
   helpful to inform users of their rights under the GPL.

   To reduce the likelihood of inaccurate practices around it, the GPL
   encourages developers to educate their users about the license terms.

   There is no warranty for this program; it is distributed in the hope
   that it will be useful, but there is no warranty of any kind; without
   even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular
   purpose. See section 11 for details.

   For more information about this license, please read it carefully since
   the largest part of the license text is not enforced unless stated
   otherwise. The license text is included below:

   
   0. Additional permission

   If the original program is released under the GNU General Public License,
   it is permissible to combine and distribute it along with other licensed
   software in a larger program.  The GPL retains validity when combined,
   this is true; however, the purposes or goals of the original project can
   dictate if incorporation with underlying licenses is possible.

   1. Definitions

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

   "You" refers to the individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted
   by this License.

   "Licensers" mean those who provide the rights to distribute, modify, and use
   the program. Only a licenser or the copyright holder can decide to release
   the Program or the given version under GPL terms. If you are not sure, please read the entire license to get a broader understanding of these rights.
   
   2. Basic Permissions

   You and other users are granted the rights to download, distribute, and modify
   The Program. You can create derived works based on The Program, known as
   derivative works. If you satisfy the license conditions you can share the
   source version, and you also have the right to prohibit other actions
   contrary to the license.

   3. Protection of Rights

   To keep your rights when distributing The Program under this license, every recipient of the standard version must have a copy of The License. You must also keep the valid license notice with all copies of The Program or derivative works. You cannot change the terms of this GNU General Public License.

   4. Redistribution

   You may copy and distribute The Program as long as you distribute the same license terms without changes or modifications of the same license. The license terms can only be modified and replaced.

   5. Modification

   You can change the source code and/or the forms of The Program under this license as long as there are no additional restrictions laid upon it.

   6. Combination

   You can merge The Program with other software, but be mindful of the license terms into which The Program is incorporated, determined by those being included.

   7. Acquisition

   You can utilize all rights granted under this License without restrictions or fees, so long as you follow The Program's license terms.  You cannot place additional restrictions on others' rights granted by The License.

   8. Distribution of Compiled forms

   You can distribute compiled forms of the program provided you can also provide corresponding source code when you distribute them, provided the rules of this license are acknowledged.

   9. Removal

   For works derived from The Program, when you remove the rights of others to produce derived works you are responsible for permissions and compliance with all the license terms.

   10. Warranty

   If you happen to upload the work under this license, you should do so with the understanding of any guarantees against liability. There is no warranty of any kind; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

   11. Limitation of liability

   In no event shall the Foundation be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect,
   incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages (including, but not
   limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data,
   or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability,
   whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or
   otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised
   of the possibility of such damage.

   12. Acceptance

   You may not use this software if you do not accept the full terms of this License unless you have prior written permission from the original copyright holder. By utilizing this software you hereby accept this License as it is stated here. Keep a copy of this License for your records.

   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible benefit to the public, the best way to learn is to study the existing GNU General Public License. You should apply this License to your new program as follows:
   
   Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
   This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
   the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
   (at your option) any later version.

   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
   WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
   GNU General Public License for more details.
   
   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
