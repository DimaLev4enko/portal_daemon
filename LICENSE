                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all its notices; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If a portion of the modified work is derived from the Program, you may distribute the modified work only under the terms of this License if the original work of the Program is not distributed.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give anyone who possesses the object code or executable form a copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above.

    c) You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by this License. You may not subsequently impose a license on the modified copy that restricts recipient's rights under this License.

  4. You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by this License. You may not subsequently impose a license on the modified copy that restricts recipient's rights under this License.

  5. This License is intended to make software available freely and under the same conditions for all users. Users should always be able to run the program as well as to modify it.  Thus, users must be able to take a copy of the program and to redistribute it with modifications while keeping the terms of this License valid. You should not take actions that would make this license invalid.

  6. If you violate the terms of this License, you lose the right to distribute the Program and its modifications under this License.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on it), you must keep intact this License notice in your distribution.

  8. If anyone requests it, you can provide a copy of this License along with the Program.

  9. You may not use the name of the Free Software Foundation or the names of its contributors to promote or endorse your modified version without proper permission.

  10. This License will be interpreted under the law of the jurisdiction where the Program is based, which should be the US law as minimum. No matter what legal cases are presented by the parties in contracts or reciprocity agreements, if the case arises it should be resolved within the limits of the residence of the copyright holder.

  11. If part or all of any provision of this License is found invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the provisions shall remain valid and enforceable.

  12. If the Program is installed on a machine that is in a different state than the one provided to you, you are required to inform the Free Software Foundation of the changes to that License.

  13. If you do not comply with this license and its provisions, the Free Software Foundation will hold your rights, but you will be unable to distribute any portion of the work you have created.

  14. Any act against these terms will make your rights invalid so the terms must always be enforced.

  15. This License makes it clear that it protects the user, not the developer. If you distribute or modify the Program you must define how to comply with this License's provisions. If you don't preserve users' rights to themselves, our work will be wasted. That is why the main goal is to maintain this License's integrity.

End of terms and conditions. Appropriateness of using the GNU General Public License for this work cannot be guaranteed.
